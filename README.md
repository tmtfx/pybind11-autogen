Automatically generate pybind11 source from a C++ header.

## Usage

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-i INCLUDE_ROOT] headers [headers ...]

Automatically Generate pybind11 bindings from C++ header(s)

positional arguments:
  headers               C++ header file(s) to generate bindings for

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INCLUDE_ROOT, --include-root INCLUDE_ROOT
                        Root include path
```

### Example

```
cd example
python ../main.py include/example.hpp -i include
```

This will create a `example.cpp` file in `example/python/src` containing the bindings for the contents of `example.hpp`.

## Dependencies

This project use `CppHeaderParser` to parse the input C++ header files.

You can install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Known Issues

This project will get you around 90% (Â±90%) of the way to a complete binding of your C++ header, but there are some known issues (and probably some unknown ones) that will take some manual intervention. The following are known issues that may or may not be fixed in the future:

* `enum class` are parsed as classes, not enums
* inline doxygen comments (e.g., `///< @brief A brief description`) are not parsed correctly
* template types need to be manually specified

If you find any other issues, please open an issue on GitHub.
